								<p>A perfect resume needs to have the things which a person is excels in but you know what makes that perticular person different from others? His thoughts, how he sees the world from a different perspective.Writing codes is something every computer guy does but Writing code for the benefit of the world is something which leaves a mark. By the way, check out my <a href="#work">Resume</a> to know more about me.</p>
								<p>So as you have looked through my resume you might have got an idea about me, who am I or what do I do but fews things which you will not know from my resume they are kind of personal to me....<br>You might be thinking what are those things. Then let me tell you I am biriyani lover and you could kindap me by serving a plate of good smelling biriyani.I am also a good cook, if not Computer Science Engineering then I might have open a small food joint.<br> I am also a Theatre practitioner and have done few theatre works with small groups and I love to do what people nowadays believe "a waste of time" because i believe "Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you a STRANGER."</p>

								<p>Throughout my 4years of engineering life i have been trying to get involve in certain projects whether it may be project using arduino or certain projects in java. I have enjoyed every bit of it and learned for both the success and failures occured during the project.</p>
								<p>Projects shows the hardwork of a man, it also explains about the knowledge the person possess.I have being trying to learn arduino code during my 1st yr and was successful in completely presenting a model of Alcohol detector for car.In my 2nd yr i have been trying to learn java and python after which I comepleted few projects in java and javafx. Some of them are as follows :</p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/asijit123/java_projects3" >Basic IRCTC type project using java</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/asijit123/java_project1">Basic Udemy type project using java</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/asijit123/javafx_try2">Web Browser using javafx</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/asijit123/javafx_try3">Tictactoe game</a></li>

								<p>Throughout my life I an just trying to learn new things whether it may be cricket or theatre.Everytime every new thing taught me something about life which I implement in my studies as well as in myself.Life is short and there are many things to left to do i am person who is always positive in life and have a urge of learning new things.In this millennial world sometimes I find myself a little old of league but on the same time I see things differently which sooths my mind and i believe in one things a famous qoute by the famous Steve Jobs "Stay Hungry,Stay Foolish"</p>
